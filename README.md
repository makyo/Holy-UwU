# Holy-UwU

Holy texts UwU-ified, though right now it's just the Bible.

# Why?

Translating these texts into UwU makes them accessible to a yet wider audience
of potential readers. I believe accessability is important.

# How?

I took Daniel Liu's
[fastest text uwifier in the west](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/uwu)
and ran whatever appropriate text file was available through it.

For The King James Bible, the source was
[the project gutenberg release](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10/pg10.txt).

Currently files are displayed using
[markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) as I have zero background in
making text look good in online displays, and markdeep apparently works. Files
are displayed through GitHub Pages, which I barely know how to use.

# License?

Completely free license subject to the terms of the original source files
(Project Gutenberg etc.) and MIT license if running through `uwuify` counts as
being under MIT license. I waive everything I possibly can.

# Contributing?

Pull requests for further holy texts are welcome if anyone really wanted that.

Also pull requests that make the files display better are cool.
